 list vs array

 array - store same data (languages - c,c++,java)
 list - store any data / flexible 

 array module - fix data type (good performance)
 numpy module we use numpy arrays 
 numpy module is built in c and it has very high and fast performance because c is fast and has high performance
 while python don't have high performance but it is the most flexible and used in most of the new tech things
 lik data science
 javascript array =~ python list / flexible
